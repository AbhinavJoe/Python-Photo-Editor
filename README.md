# Python-Photo-Editor
A python photo editor that makes use of the pillow module. This is just a basic implementation of the module to do basic photo editing based on the code provided. 
When the code is run, the photo in the `imgs` folder will be edited and an edited version of the photo will be added to the `editedImgs` folder.
