# Python-Photo-Editor

This repository contains a basic Python script for photo editing using the Pillow library. The script applies a series of enhancements, including sharpening, black and white conversion, transformation, rotation, and contrast adjustment, to images in the specified input directory. The edited images are then saved to the output directory. To use the script, ensure you have Python and Pillow installed on your machine. Clone the repository, set the input and output directories in the script, and run it using the `python photoeditor.py` command.
